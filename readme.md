## A Pokemon Showdown Team Manager Written in Go
### Created By Damon Murdoch ([@SirScrubbington](https://github.com/SirScrubbington))

## Introduction
PSManage is a Pokemon Showdown Team Manager, which has been developed for the purpose of
backing up and storing Pokemon Showdown teams in a simple and easy to access format. It
takes the raw text export from Pokemon Showdown and converts it to a folder structure which
can be easily navigated and saved to version control. It also has the ability to re-import
the folder structure generated and it can then be imported into Pokemon Showdown. 

For a full description of how to use the application, please refer to the post on my blog 
[here](http://sir-scrubbington.hatenablog.com/entry/2021/03/14/105329).
